are you inside mindful steps and ready to do more coding?
I'd like to add a step goal to the app and a walk log

we need to address storage, it is currently just using local storage, but we need to try to integrate Vultr into the application, can we do that for storage?

how do I set up OAuth?
I don't want to use Apple, just Google, I have added the client ID and secret to the .env.local file
Access blocked: This apps request is invalid
I'm getting successfully authenticated message then it says redirecting and takes me back to the google login page

make sure you are not using emojis for testing responses
yes, that worked
it's still redirecting back to the google login page

I'm in the app as a test user...how do we get it to authorize an actual sign in?
there is no 'Clear Auth'

there is no floating button, there is no red button on the debug panel

GET http://localhost:3000/ 500 (Internal Server Error)
the 500 error is gone but so is the entire app
yes, the step counter is working
the step counter isn't working right
there's a button that says "RotateCcw className="w-5 h-5" /> Reset"
the card went to a very light color when I pressed start, it should stay the same color, not change - the step counter is tracking the phone movement, not actual steps - the pause button didn't work
I walked 37 steps and the step counter counted 75, that's way off
that's better...now let's get the gallery back
the 500 error is back

Maybe one of these should be marked as a client entry with "use client":
  ./src\app\page.tsx
there is not a 500 error currently
the step counter is working, the colors are not right, though
the cards are all different colors, they should all be the same color, a slightly different shade than the background
yes, that's better - can we add back the other functionality now, one at a time to make sure there are no other errors
so far so good
GET http://localhost:3000/ 500 (Internal Server Error)
the 500 error is gone again
that seems to work
seems ok
GET http://localhost:3000/ 500 (Internal Server Error)
theh error is gone
1
that seems to be working, no 500 error
start with the walktracker
I don't see settings where the user can actually set their step goal
are you going to add the settings for goals?
I need you to implement the settings where users can add their step goals
the settings icon probably makes more sense to be in the daily goals section
that's better, now let's add the photo taking and gallery feature back
the gallery isn't actually showing any pictures

the gallery should allow users to view images individually, also to share or delete photos
the current walk stats box is not the right color, it's a white background and it should be a darker background like the others
the capture moment should open the user's camera not just upload a random image
it's still just uploading a random image instead of using the camera
now I'm just getting black images

the camera seems to be working and the gallery is showing the images, however, we no longer have a share or delete option in the gallery
delete is working but share is not working
that all seems to be working now...do we have the mindful moment prompts active? every 50-1500 steps a prompt should come up suggesting the user look around (up, down, left, right, forward, back, look for specific colors, texures or smells, etc)
I'd like to make sure there is a sound and a vibration(where possible) when the mindful moments appear
I don't like that sound, let's use something a little more peaceful sounding
it still sounds like a whistle
that sounds too gong like...can you do just a couple gentle tones?
that's good...let's make the vibration a bit more robust, though
let's remove the card on the top that says " Testing WalkTracker Component!
Adding back advanced walk tracking features"
I have a logo that can be used in place of the "Mindful Steps" text, what folder should I put the image into?
I just added logo.png to the public folder, please use that in place of the "Mindful Steps" text at the top of the page
let's add google maps back, so the user can see where they are on the map
great...now let's add the Vultr storage
how do I set up Vultr to be active, don't I need an account and/or API key?
the dashboard of Vultr doesn't say anything about Object Storage
I have to use Vultr in this program for something
1. Get a Vultr VPS (1GB RAM, $6/month or less) the $6/mo plan only offers 1GB RAM, 16GB of RAM are $80/mo and higher
let's skip Vultr for now, their services aren't working at the moment...can we set up google Oauth for logging in

when I have the map showing, it has things overlapping, the current location and "Google Maps Ready" messages are showing up beneath the Cloud Sync Ready and Google Login info
let's just remove the "Google Maps Ready" message altogether, it's not needed
I don't think we need the cloud sync message, either

no...that is not where I want it...I want it inside the the walk tracker, above the daily goal, but below the step counter
yes, that is finally in the right place - now make the icon a react icon instead of an emoji, it should match all the other icons
the simple and advanced icons need to be changed to react icons as well
make the Photo Gallery title and icon the same size and placement as the others
the photo gallery title is still smaller and further to the left than the other caard titles
you added another photo gallery card instead of editing the one that was already there, now there are two and one has the correct title size and the other does not
ok....remove the second camera icon and 'Your Photos' text
make sure the view photos button is still on the right side
the photo gallery card is too tall, the view photo button should be on the same line/row as the title
there's a rocket emoji next to "Let's Begin" text that needs to be changed to a react icone
the walking streak card is using a bright orange color, it should be the same golden color as the rest of the app
This week is using a blue color for the icon, it should be the primary color, same for the this month card, it should be primary instead of green
we can remove the bell emoji now that we have the sound and vibration set, we don't need that to test it anymore
"This Week" and "This Month" icons and titles need to match the size and spacing of the other cards
I don't think we need the status card at the bottom of the screen anymore, let's remove that
on the google auth card at the top, we don't need the message "Signed In", just the "Sign Out" button should be sufficient
let's add Vultr object storage now
do I just need one bucket?
I think I have all the correct information in the .env.local file, I named the bucket mindful-steps
Vultr API not available - using localStorage only
the app doesn't seem to be connecting to the Vultr bucket
Vultr API not available - using localStorage only
Vultr is saving images but does not appear to be saving walk data
